"scrape-xxxx (replace system with X's)" is basically the first pass, and does the scraping and caching of the media from ScreenScraper.

"compile-xxxx (replace system with X's)" is basically the second pass, it does the generating part of making your scraped media useable in EmulationStation and such.
